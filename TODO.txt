- Start "Session" API to provide domain functionality, e.g.:
    - "connections" object could work with object references instead of names
    - a source_groups list, where each SourceGroup has a linear_pipeline, colour_pipeline,
      look_pipeline, etc. (as PipelineGroup object, or something).
    - per-node-type classes, e.g. RVColor, would have known version numbers
    - dot-style property setting:
        obj['lut.active'] = 1
        obj['lut.file'] = '/path/to/lut.cube'
    - other methods to match the Mu api (including "$" and "#" searching)

- dot representation
